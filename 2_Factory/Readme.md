## Factory Assigment
You are given a class called Person . The person has two fields: id , and name .

Please implement a non-static PersonFactory that has a create_person()  method that takes a person's name.

The id  of the person should be set as a 0-based index of the object created. So, the first person the factory makes should have id=0, second id=1 and so on.
